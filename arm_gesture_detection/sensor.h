/* MPU9250 Basic Example Code

 find it useful you can buy me a beer some time.
 
 Demonstrate basic MPU-9250 functionality including parameterizing the register addresses, initializing the sensor, 
 getting properly scaled accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data out. Added display functions to 
 allow display to on breadboard monitor. Addition of 9 DoF sensor fusion using open source Madgwick and 
 Mahony filter algorithms. Sketch runs on the 3.3 V 8 MHz Pro Mini and the Teensy 3.1.
 
 SDA and SCL should have external pull-up resistors (to 3.3V).
 10k resistors are on the EMSENSR-9250 breakout board.
 
 Hardware setup:
 MPU9250 Breakout --------- Arduino
 VDD ---------------------- 3.3V
 VDDI --------------------- 3.3V
 SDA ----------------------- A4
 SCL ----------------------- A5
 GND ---------------------- GND
 
 Note: The MPU9250 is an I2C sensor and uses the Arduino Wire library. 
 Because the sensor is not 5V tolerant, we are using a 3.3 V 8 MHz Pro Mini or a 3.3 V Teensy 3.1.
 We have disabled the internal pull-ups used by the Wire library in the Wire.h/twi.c utility file.
 We are also using the 400 kHz fast I2C mode by setting the TWI_FREQ  to 400000L /twi.h utility file.
